<h2>Align spectrum retention times across samples using peak groups
found in most samples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function performs retention time correction by assessing
the retention time deviation across all samples using peak groups
(features) containg chromatographic peaks present in most/all samples.
The retention time deviation for these features in each sample is
described by fitting either a polynomial (<code>smooth = "loess"</code>) or
a linear (<code>smooth = "linear"</code>) model to the data points. The
models are subsequently used to adjust the retention time for each
spectrum in each sample.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
do_adjustRtime_peakGroups(peaks, peakIndex, rtime, minFraction = 0.9,
  extraPeaks = 1, smooth = c("loess", "linear"), span = 0.2,
  family = c("gaussian", "symmetric"), peakGroupsMatrix = matrix(ncol = 0,
  nrow = 0))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peaks</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>matrix</code> or <code>data.frame</code> with the identified
chromatographic peaks in the samples.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peakIndex</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>list</code> of indices that provides the grouping
information of the chromatographic peaks (across and within samples).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rtime</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>list</code> of <code>numeric</code> vectors with the retention
times per file/sample.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>minFraction</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric(1)</code> between 0 and 1 defining the minimum
required fraction of samples in which peaks for the peak group were
identified. Peak groups passing this criteria will aligned across
samples and retention times of individual spectra will be adjusted
based on this alignment. For <code>minFraction = 1</code> the peak group
has to contain peaks in all samples of the experiment.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>extraPeaks</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric(1)</code> defining the maximal number of
additional peaks for all samples to be assigned to a peak group (i.e.
feature) for retention time correction. For a data set with 6 samples,
<code>extraPeaks = 1</code> uses all peak groups with a total peak count
<code>&lt;= 6 + 1</code>. The total peak count is the total number of peaks being
assigned to a peak group and considers also multiple peaks within a
sample being assigned to the group.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>smooth</code></td>
<td>
<p>character defining the function to be used, to interpolate
corrected retention times for all peak groups. Either <code>"loess"</code> or
<code>"linear"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>span</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric(1)</code> defining the degree of smoothing (if
<code>smooth = "loess"</code>). This parameter is passed to the internal call
to <code><a href="../../stats/html/loess.html">loess</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>family</code></td>
<td>
<p>character defining the method to be used for loess smoothing.
Allowed values are <code>"gaussian"</code> and <code>"symmetric"</code>.See
<code><a href="../../stats/html/loess.html">loess</a></code> for more information.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peakGroupsMatrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional <code>matrix</code> of (raw) retention times for
peak groups on which the alignment should be performed. Each column
represents a sample, each row a feature/peak group. If not provided,
this matrix will be determined depending on parameters
<code>minFraction</code> and <code>extraPeaks</code>. If provided,
<code>minFraction</code> and <code>extraPeaks</code> will be ignored.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The alignment bases on the presence of compounds that can be found
in all/most samples of an experiment. The retention times of individual
spectra are then adjusted based on the alignment of the features 
corresponding to these <em>house keeping compounds</em>. The paraneters
<code>minFraction</code> and <code>extraPeaks</code> can be used to fine tune which
features should be used for the alignment (i.e. which features 
most likely correspond to the above mentioned house keeping compounds).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>list</code> with <code>numeric</code> vectors with the adjusted
retention times grouped by sample.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The method ensures that returned adjusted retention times are
increasingly ordered, just as the raw retention times.
